# Python_Roadmap

I am sharing my journey of Python in data analytics from basic to intermediate. 

My previous experience in Python is taking CSC108H course at U of T where I learned the basics of Python including variable, list, for loop, while loop, if - else, function, and data types (string, boolean, dictionary, tuple, set).
