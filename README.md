# Data_Analyst_Roadmap

I am sharing my journey to study data analysis. It will contain all the contents/resources/links/projects required to be a data analyst including Python, SQL, R, Excel, Tableau and Power BI.  

My previous experience in data analysis is as follows: 

I have previously taken a computer science course in python, CSC108H from University of Toronto where I learned the basics of Python including variables, lists, for loops, while loops, if - else statements, functions, and data types (strings, booleas, dictionarys, tuples, sets). 

I spent quite some time learning SQL using MySQL/Postgresql and picked up some fundamental concepts like Select, Order by, Group by, Distinct, Where, Having, Insert, Create, Update Joins, Subqueries, Case, CTE. I have solved all the easy questions in SQL in LeetCode, and some intermediate questions. 

I have worked on a couple of projects in R/Python such as Premier_League_Home_Advantage and 2020_US_Election_Result_Analysis, with the latter being recognized as a distinguished paper by the prof.
