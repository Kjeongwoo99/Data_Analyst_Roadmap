# Data_Analyst_Roadmap

I am sharing my journey to study data analysis. It will contain all the contents/resources/links/projects required to be a good data analyst including Python, SQL, R, Excel, Tableau, Power BI.  

My previous experience in data analysis is as fallows. 

I have previously taken a computer science course in python: CSC108H from U of T where I learned the basics of Python including variable, list, for loop, while loop, if - else, function, and data types (string, boolean, dictionary, tuple, set). 

I spent quite some time learning SQL using MySQL and I picked up some fundamental concepts like Select, Order by, Group by, Distinct, Where, Having, Insert, Create, Update Joins, Subqueries, Case, CTE. I have solved all the easy questions in sql in leetcode, and some intermediate questions. 

I have worked on a couple of projects in R/Python such as Premier_League_Home_Advantage and 2020_US_Election_Result_Analysis, in which the latter was recognized as distinguished paper by the prof.
